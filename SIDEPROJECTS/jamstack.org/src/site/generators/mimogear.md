description: A super simple static site generator and web development boilerplate.
---

**Mimogear** is a complete web development boilerplate for developing static sites. By pairing with **gulp**, a powerful node based task runner, Mimogear automatically compiles a responsive **sass** skeleton boilerplate, renders a **pug** template boilerplate, concatenates & uglifies an optional javascript module bundle, and begins watching assets for changes. Newcomers and professionals alike will feel right at home with a solid start for any static site!

### Philosophy

In the heart of Mimogear lies **simplicity**, **speed**, and **flexibility**. This foundation builds on the constant thought and revision of markup, styles, and modules that hold true to most use cases without blasting through the learning curve roof. As a result, Mimogear serves as a reliable base for front end web development.
