description: ðŸ”¥ Easy and flexible static site generator for Deno ðŸ¦•
---

**ðŸ”¥ Lume** is the galician word for *fire,* but also a (yet another) static site generator for Deno.

It's inspired in other general purpose static site generators such Jekyll or Eleventy but it's simpler and easier to use and configure, besides being super flexible.

- Support for **multiple file formats** like `markdown`, `yaml`, `javascript`, `typescript`, `jsx`, `nunjucks` and it's easy to extend.
- You can hook **any processor** to transform assets, like `sass` or `postcss` for CSS.
- It's Deno: forget about manage thousand of packages in `node_modules` or complex bundlers. Lume only install that you need. Clean, fast and secure.
