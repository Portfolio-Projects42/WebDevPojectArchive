description: Haskell static site generator with hot reload
---

Ema is a next-gen Haskell library toolkit for building jamstack-style static sites. Ema sites are change-aware; in addition to good olâ€™ static site generation, it provides a live server supporting fast hot-reload in the browser on code or data change.

Ema is designed to facilitate creation of apps whose data is normally edited via traditional mechanisms (eg: text editor) but rendered as a delightful web page - so as to provide an economical read-only view of your data on desktop & mobile.
