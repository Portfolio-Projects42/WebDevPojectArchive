## ApostropheCMS
Apostrophe is a globally-minded technology company focused on creating incredible open source content management tools for organizations—from small businesses to the enterprise. Our products empower our customers to take ownership over their digital experiences. As a full-featured JavaScript CMS with both headless capabilities through the [headless module](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-headless) and core in-context editing, our tools appeal to both developers and content editors, not only because of how flexible they are, but because they feel good to use. Our customers’ success in their digital experiences is a result of the impact of our products.

### Headless
Run Apostrophe in the JAMstack. Add REST APIs to your Apostrophe content, powering your React/Vue/etc. apps with a headless CMS.

### Open Source
Open source is in our blood. Apostrophe was built on the foundation of best in class open source projects and is distributed with an open source license to carry that practice forward.

### Full Stack Javascript
The latest JavaScript best practices on the front and back-end, allowing for less gear switching and faster development.

### In-Context Editing
Editing has never been easier. Users can edit content directly on the page, via a familiar interface. Uploaded images automatically resize to suit the right balance of bandwidth and presentation. Adhere to your brand standards without limited editing control.

### Integrations
Bring your favorites tools to your CMS experience. Whether it's Hubspot, Salesforce, Google Analytics, or another platform of choice, Apostrophe can integrate with your tools for a comprehensive management experience.
