# ðŸ–Œ Joy of Code

[Joy of Code](https://joyofcode.xyz/) is a digital garden where I tend to web development topics for humans.

> The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there. - [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)

I dislike the permanence of content on the internet. I consider posts living documents. The garden is a metaphor, where focus is spent on tending to the garden.
