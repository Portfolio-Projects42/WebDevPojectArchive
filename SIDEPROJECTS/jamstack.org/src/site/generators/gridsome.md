Build blazing fast websites for any CMS or data with Vue.js

![How Gridsome work](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/878bujtx44yni3oub1hf.gif)

# How Gridsome works

Use local files or any external API as a data source and access the data from a unified GraphQL layer

## Connect to any CMS or data source

Use any CMS or data source for content. Pull data from WordPress, Contentful, local Markdown, or any other headless CMS or APIs and access it with GraphQL in your pages and components.

## Enjoy a modern development stack

Build websites with modern tools like Vue.js, webpack and Node.js. Get hot-reloading and access to any packages from npm and write CSS in your favorite preprocessor like Sass or Less with autoprefixing.

## PWA Offline-first architecture

Only critical HTML, CSS, and JavaScript get loaded first. The next pages are then prefetched so users can click around incredibly fast without page reloads, even when offline.

## Get perfect page speed scores

Gridsome automatically optimises your frontend to load and perform blazing fast. You get code-splitting, image optimisation, lazy-loading, and almost perfect lighthouse scores out-of-the-box.

## Build future ready websites

The future of the web is JavaScript, API's, and Markup - the Jamstack. Gridsome uses the power of blazing-fast static site generator, JavaScript and APIs to create stunning dynamic web experiences.

## Ready for global domination

Gridsome sites are usually not connected to any database and can be hosted entirely on a global CDN. It can handle thousands to millions of hits without breaking - and no expensive server costs.
