**CODEDOC** is an open-source tool that helps you with creating beautiful and modern software documentation. It creates a JAMStack app from your markdown files that you can easily deploy on services such as GitHub Pages.

**CODEDOC** supports [an extended Markdown syntax](https://codedoc.cc/docs/markdown/overview) allowing for custom structural components like buttons, tabs, collapsible content, etc, all in your markdown. You can even easily [create your own custom components](https://codedoc.cc/docs/markdown/custom-components) and use them in your markdown.

**CODEDOC** comes with out-of-the-box features designed to maximize readability and usability of your docs, specifically [on code snippets](https://codedoc.cc/docs/code/overview).

**CODEDOC** is easily configurable and extensible. You can change any aspect of it from the color schemes and fonts to the whole layout.
