description: A simple static website generator written in Elixir.
---

Serum is yet another static website generator written in [Elixir Programming Language](http://elixir-lang.org). The goal of this project is to provide the way to create awesome static websites with little effort. Powered by super-lightweight Erlang processes, Serum can build hundreds of pages simultaneously, enabling fast live tests (using Serum development server) and fast deployment of your website.

Check [the sample website](http://include.iostream.kr/serum-sample) to see what Serum can do! The official website of Serum is under construction and will take position of the sample site.
