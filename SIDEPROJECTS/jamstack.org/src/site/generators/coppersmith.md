CopperSmith is a very simple static site builder that uses markdown files.

Using simple commands, you can quickly scaffold your site leaving you to simply edit the content of your pages.

Once built, the site can be hosted anywhere static HTML content is supported, like GitHub Pages and Netlify.

CopperSmith also comes with a simple FTP publisher, allowing you to easily upload your generated site to your plain FTP server.

Templating is supported and allows you to easily change the layout and styling with your own custom layouts and partials using the [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templating engine.

Read the [templating docs](http://charlgottschalk.co.za/projects/coppersmith/docs/master/templates-setup) for more info.

View the [project page](http://charlgottschalk.co.za/projects/coppersmith) for [documentation](http://charlgottschalk.co.za/projects/coppersmith/docs).
