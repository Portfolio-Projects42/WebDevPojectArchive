description: A minimalist configuration for generating static sites, powered entirely by NPM scripts.
---

Static Lite is a minimalist configuration for generating static sites, powered entirely by NPM scripts. Static Lite is less of a framework and more of an ideology suggesting that developers should take control of their build process. This configuration comes with a default stack to get up and running, but the framework suggests developers update it to match their unique needs.

There is no external build tool for this static site generator, so duplicate the Static Lite repo to get started.
