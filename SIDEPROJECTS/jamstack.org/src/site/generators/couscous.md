### Step 1

Write your documentation in Markdown inside your repository, versioned with your code. Couscous will turn those Markdown files to HTML.

### Step 2

`couscous preview` will render the website on your machine. Tweak the default template, fix some typos and the changes will be reflected in real time.

### Step 3

couscous deploy will publish your website on the gh-pages Git branch. GitHub will automatically put it online and host it for you.

### Step 4

Your website is online, just sit back and relax.
