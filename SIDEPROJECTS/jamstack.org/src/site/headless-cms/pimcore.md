## Key Benefits and Advantages
### ‚öí Data Modelling and UI Design at the same Time 
No matter if you're dealing with unstructured web documents or structured data for MDM/PIM, you define the 
UI design (web documents by a template and structured data with a intuitive graphical editor), Pimcore knows 
how to persist the data efficiently and optimized for fast access.

### üéõ Agnostic and Universal Framework for your Data
Due to the framework approach, Pimcore is very flexible and adapts perfectly to your needs. Built on top of 
the well-known Symfony Framework you have a solid and modern foundation for your project. 

### üöÄ Extensible and huge Symfony Community
Benefit from all existing Symfony Components and Bundles provided by the community or create your own 
Bundles to extend your Projects with reusable components. 

### üíé Your Digital World consolidated in one Platform
No more API, import/export and synchronization hell between MDM/PIM, E-Commerce, DAM, and your Web-CMS. 
All is working seamlessly together, natively ... this is what Pimcore is built for. 

### ‚ú®Ô∏è Data Hub for Headless Content Management
With GraphQL endpoints, Data Hub allows to provide content managed in Pimcore to other systems and services and test them with the integrated GraphiQL explorer tool right away.
