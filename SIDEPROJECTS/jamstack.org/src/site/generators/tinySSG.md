Tiny SSG is a static site generator built with Python.
It can read markdown files, but it has also some interesting features for pre-processing the images.

I made this tool for a client who wanted to turn his website into a static one, in order to improve the security and the performances.
As the original site included more than 300 images, I needed to code something to process all of them in various sizes,
and to implement a lazy loading.
