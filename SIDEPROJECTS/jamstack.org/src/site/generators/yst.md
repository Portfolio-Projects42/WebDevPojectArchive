description: Static websites from YAML and string templates
---

`yst` is a tool for generating a static website by filling [string
template](http://www.stringtemplate.org/)s with data taken from [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) or [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) text files or
[SQLite3](http://www.sqlite.org/) file based databases. This approach
combines the speed, security, and ease of deployment of a static
website with the flexibility and maintainability of a dynamic site that
separates presentation and data.
