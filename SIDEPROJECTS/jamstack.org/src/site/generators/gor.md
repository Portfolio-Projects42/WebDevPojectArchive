description: A static websites and blog generator engine written in Go
---

Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs.
**Gor** is a [Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/)-like websites and blog generator engine written in [Go](http://golang.org/). Itâ€™s almost compatible to ruhoh 1.x specification. You can treat Gor as a replacement of the official implementation that is written in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

Why reinvent the wheel? Gor has the following awesome benefits:

1. Speed&mdash;Less than 1 second when compiling all my near 200 blogs on wendal.net
2. Simple&mdash;Only one single executable file generated after compiling, no other dependency
