description: Gloria is a static site generator, a beginners friendly project
---

Gloria is Spanish for glory, also the name of my mom and the name was available in npm.

This project aims to be a substitute for jekyll, to help you create static websites without depending on ruby.

## Community

We have a slack team, there are channels to talk about contributing, support, updates, meta and everything.

Request an invite [here](http://slack.gloriajs.com/).

## Philosophy

Gloria works as easy as possible, with extensions to allow you to use your favorite template engine,
CSS preprocessor, and anything else.

Our goal is to have an open source project that is beginner friendly, if you want to contribute
but have little experience as a developer or in open source, we can pair with you and help you. Is a great
excuse to work in a non-trivial Node codebase and get started on open source.
