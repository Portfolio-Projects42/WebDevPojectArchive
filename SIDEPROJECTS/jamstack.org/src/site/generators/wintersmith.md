description: A flexible static site generator with awesome plugins.
---

Wintersmith is a simple yet flexible static site generator. It takes contents (markdown, less, scripts, etc), transforms them using plugins and outputs a static website (html, css, images, etc) that you can host anywhere.

It ships with plugins for [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [jade templates](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade), if you need something else check the [plugin listing](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith/wiki/Plugins) or [write your own](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith/wiki/Writing-plugins)
