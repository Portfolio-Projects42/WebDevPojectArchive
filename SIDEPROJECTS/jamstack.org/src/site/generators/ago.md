description: A static blog generator script without any fuzz

## What's Ago?

Ago is a small static blog generator without any fuzz. It's stupidly simple, not at all built upon any of the fanciest algorithms or the most widely tested libraries. It's small, simple and works!

### Features

- Create and write new posts
- Configure domain, name, author and a few more fields
- Transpile markdown posts into html files
- Atom and RSS -feeds are generated when running -transpile
- Basic proper html5 semantics
- 100/100 pagespeed results
- No ability what so ever to affect the layout
- You can modify the css file but it'll be overwritten on next transpile
