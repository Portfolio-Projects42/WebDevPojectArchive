description: Serif is a static site generator and an optional admin interface
---

Serif is a static site generator and blogging system powered by markdown files and an optional admin interface complete with drag-and-drop image uploading. ([Check out the simple video demo](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxPQpxGSOOyKS1J4MmlnM3JIaXM).)

Serif releases you from managing a file system so you can focus on writing content.

### Intro

Serif is a lot like Jekyll with a few extra moving parts. Its main aim is to provide two things:

1. Simplicity: the source and generated content are just files that can be served by any web server.
2. Ease of publishing, wherever you are.

Serif is sort of a blend between Jekyll, [Second Crack](https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack) and ideas from [Svbtle](http://dcurt.is/codename-svbtle). There should be flexibility with writing content, such as using the web interface, `rsync`ing from a remote machine, or editing a draft file on the remote server and having everything happen for you.
