Harold (create-harold-app) is a simple tool that provides a ready-to-use template for creating your static websites and blogs. It is based on well-known Handlebars, Markdown and Scss to be simple to use and start.

By default, you have access to JSON data with all posts. It is useful when you want to do something dynamic using JavaScript. For example, 'load more' functionality or search. The search system is implemented already in the default template.

```
npm init harold-app my-app
```
