Systatic is a Modern Static Site Generator built in PHP. It's faster and simpler than traditional static site generators.

## Features

- Collections
- Pull content from Remote Locations (like APIs)
- Laravel Blade templating
- Importers for WordPress, Jekyll & Ghost
- Plugin System

## Use your own technology stack

Apart from using PHP to generate your site, you can use whatever tech stack you want, Vue, React, whatever. We don't dictate what you need.

## No need for traditional servers

Because Systatic generates HTML files, you can host your site anywhere you can put HTML files: Netlify, Github Pages, Amazon S3.

## Data from everywhere

You can put your data where ever you want. You could have it in Markdown files, WordPress or even a headless CMS and it will all work and feel the same.
