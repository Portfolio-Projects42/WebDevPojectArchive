Static Markdown is a tool for converting Markdown and HTML articles into full websites.

Packaged as an NPM module, it is easy to install, run, and integrate into a build process.

You can start with a theme from the the repository, and change it as you wish.

Don't repeat yourself, use templates to fill in site-wide variables and article specific ones.
