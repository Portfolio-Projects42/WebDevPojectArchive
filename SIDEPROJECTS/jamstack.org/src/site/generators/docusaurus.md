## Powered by Markdown

Save time and focus on your project's documentation. Simply write docs and blog posts with Markdown and Docusaurus will publish a set of static html files ready to serve.

## Built Using React

Extend or customize your project's layout by reusing React. Docusaurus can be extended while reusing the same header and footer.

## Ready for Translations

Localization comes pre-configured. Use Crowdin to translate your docs into over 70 languages.

## Document Versioning

Support users on all versions of your project. Document versioning helps you keep documentation in sync with project releases.

## Document Search

Make it easy for your community to find what they need in your documentation. We proudly support Algolia documentation search.
