# Headless content for any front end

Create, curate, and distribute content to any channel. Enonic strives
to make day to day operations easier for everyone involved. With the
fully customizable Enonic platform, developers and editors can work
together to build better solutions. Enonic is the perfect compromise.

Enonic's open platform, software development kit, and intuitive
framework enable developers to quickly become productive. Easily
integrate with your existing development pipeline and best practices.

## Searchable

All your content is automatically indexed and searchable down to
single fields. Aggregate and search across your content and get search
scoring and highlighting, even for files.

## GraphQL API for all your data

Instantly access your data from any device or client with the strongly
typed GraphQL API. Get exactly what you need and nothing more with a
single query. You can even customize and extend the API to meet your
requirements.

## Easy images

The image handling tools make it easy to insert, edit and share images
across every platform and device. Scale, crop, and set focal points to
[make your images pop in every situation](https://enonic.com/blog/enonic-simplifies-image-problems).

## Managed or self-hosted, on-prem or in the cloud

Enonic is available as a managed platform for faster deployment and
improved security, or you can host it yourself in your cloud of choice
or on-prem.
