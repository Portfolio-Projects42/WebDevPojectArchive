description: Simple and extensible static site generator powered by Grunt.
---

Cabin's goal is to be a static site generator that encourages designers and developers to make themes and share them with the open source community. We want to make it easy to create and install themes so that theme authors can focus on developing themes, and users can quickly get up and running with their static sites.

Cabin should be usable by everyone who knows how to edit markdown, templates, and css. At the same time, we want to provide support for Grunt power users and evolve with the Grunt ecosystem. As such, we plan on having a minimal default Gruntfile and providing options for power users to scaffold a more advanced Gruntfile.
