## Built for speed

Clicking is lame. With enduro.js, exactly zero clicks are necessary to build the whole project.

## Killer admin ui

Somebody non-technical will eventually manage content on the website. You might as well provide this person with awesome, beautiful, quick and simple experience.

## Blazing fast

Slow pageloads are the worst. Enduro pregenerates pages to provide the fastest possible response time. Coupled with direct uploading to cdn - can't get any faster.

## Build tool

Sass check. Spritessheet generation check. Enduro.js comes with set of build tools to build everything on the server. Forget about ftping built files.

## Live reload

Enduro.js comes with browsersync build in and everything hooked up. Change the color in sass file - BOOM - 0.1 seconds later you see the new color in your browser.

## Code separation

Enduro.js is built around handlebars. Logiless templates. No way to spagetticode it now.

## Shared templates

Html components written for backend are accessible to frontend's javascript as well. Amazing.

## Isomorphic javascript

Using javascript for both frontend and backend is just a great idea. With enduro.js, all your javascript modules can now be loaded by page generation, api and frontend code.

## Deploy by git

What do you need to deploy the project? Git url. Thats it. Everything is set up. Server will build everything with enduro.js.

## Scalable

Enduro.js projects are self-contained and ready to be web-scaled with push of a button.

## Flat files

No database. Just tiny flat files. Ready to be edited by your favorite text editor. Incredibly convenient, ready to be stored in git. No setup required.

## Rapid api

Enduro comes with a simple framework built on top of express. Using raw power of node.js you can add mongodb or complex functionality to your website.

## Simple

Learning curve so flat it is actually going down. No setup, no magic. Enduro.js comes with a scaffolding to set you up and get you running quickly.

## Multilingual

So you are making a website that will be published in multiple languages? Built in. Out of the box. No setup.

## Open source

Enduro.js is open-source and free to use. Distributed under the MIT License

## Good parts

Only the best ingredients were used when making Enduro. Handlebars, Sass, Gulp, Bootstrap, Angularjs, Browsersync, Express, Jasmine, Git, Npm and Heroku
