description: A configurable Haskell library, for small-to-medium sites.
---

Static sites are fast, secure, easy to deploy, and manageable using version control.

Hakyll is a Haskell library for generating static sites, mostly aimed at small-to-medium sites and personal blogs. It is written in a very configurable way and uses an xmonad-like DSL for configuration.

Integration with pandoc gives us markdown and TeX support, including syntax highlighting and other goodies.
