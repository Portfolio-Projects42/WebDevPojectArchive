SiteFi is a simple and highly configurable static site generator for F#. It uses WebSharper to build the pages of your website and to generate HTML files for them.

### Features

 * Get a full, standalone HTML blog, ready to deploy
 * Tag your articles with categories, and get search pages for each automatically
 * RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 feeds
 * Syntax highlighting for F# code blocks
 * Develop dynamic articles in F#, with charts, visualizations, etc.
 * Streamlined development workflow for template changes (style, layout, etc.) - see effects immediately, but only rebuild when you are done
