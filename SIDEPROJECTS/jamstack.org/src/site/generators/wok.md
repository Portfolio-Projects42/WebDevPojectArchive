---

Wok is similar in concept to other static site generators, like Jekyll, Hyde,
and nanoc, but different in a few ways, like a page/subpage category system,
and a restricted focus of features. For example, instead of providing tools to
generate RSS feeds directly, the tools that are needed to build a generic XML
document are provided.

Wok offers:

- Content and presentation are separated
- Markdown, reStructuredText, and plain text renders
- Jinja2-based templating system
- Optional syntax highlighting via Pygments
- Tagging and a hierarchical category system
- Simple development server
- Pagination support
- Custom Python hooks that run during site generation
