**Dead simple**

It's hard enough getting a website going without having to muck around learning new ecosystems and code. 
`squido` has **everything** you need to get started built into the core so you don't *have* to write plugins (but can). 

**Markdown / Yaml**

Write the main posts/pages in Markdown with Yaml meta data. Dead simple stuff which you likely already know.

**Deployment**

We know deployment can be hard. We've written all the steps needed to host on [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), [AWS](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home) etc. 
We've even integrated direct with the [Netlify](https://netlify.com) API so you don't even have to learn Git!
