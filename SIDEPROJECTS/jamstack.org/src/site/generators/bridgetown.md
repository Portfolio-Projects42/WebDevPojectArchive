Built upon proven open source technology as a "reimagined" fork of Jekyll, Bridgetown is a fast, scalable, modular, and thoroughly forward-looking framework for building websites and frontend applications.

## Write Content

Content in Bridgetown is simply text files in your repository. Write flexible Markdown and use sophisticated Liquid tags to enhance your presentation and functionality. Using a headless CMS or third-party APIs? That works too!

## Design with Components

Encapsulate common building-blocks of your design which can be reused across multiple pages and contexts or displayed in an always up-to-date style guide.

## Customize with Plugins

Write your own plugins in the delightful Ruby programming language to facilitate totally custom projects, or simply add community gems to supercharge your site build.

## Add a Modern Frontend

Bridgetown comes with support for Webpack out-of-the-box, which means you can add Javascript frameworks like React, Vue, Stimulus as well as CSS frameworks like Bulma or Tailwind to get a leg up fast.

## Future Roadmap

Bridgetown has an extenstive roadmap and strives to maintain a predictable release schedule. A key goal of the project is to be a reliable partner for commercial solution providers by ensuring their frontline work with clients goes well and feedback flows positively into the Bridgetown feature set.
