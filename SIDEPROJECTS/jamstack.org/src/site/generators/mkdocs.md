MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

- Host anywhere.

  Builds completely static HTML sites that you can host on GitHub pages, Amazon S3, or anywhere else you choose.

- Great themes available.

  There's a stack of good looking themes included by default. Choose from bootstrap, readthedocs, ghostwriter, or any of the 12 bootswatch themes.

- Preview your site as you work.

  The built-in devserver allows you to preview your documentation as your writing it. It will even auto-reload whenever you save any changes, so all you need to do to see your latest edits is refresh your browser.

- Easy to customize.

  Get your project documentation looking just the way you want it by customizing the theme.

- Cross-reference your documentation.

  Create richly cross-referenced documents, using the MkDocs interlinking syntax.
