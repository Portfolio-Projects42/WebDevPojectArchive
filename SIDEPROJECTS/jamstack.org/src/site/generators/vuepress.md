# Simplicity First

Minimal setup with markdown-centered project structure helps you focus on writing.

# Vue-Powered

Enjoy the dev experience of Vue + webpack, use Vue components in markdown, and develop custom themes with Vue.

# Performant

VuePress generates pre-rendered static HTML for each page, and runs as an SPA once a page is loaded.

# As Easy as 1, 2, 3

```bash
# install
npm install -g vuepress

# create a markdown file
echo "# Hello VuePress" > README.md

# start writing
vuepress dev

# build to static files
vuepress build
```
