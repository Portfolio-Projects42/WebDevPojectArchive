Static site generator for Grav CMS.

### Why use Blackhole?

1. Blackhole is incredibly powerful because you can use Grav as a backend and blackhole to deploy the generated pages routinely.
1. Benefit from Grav (a dynamic flat-file cms) and the speed and security of a static site, without the manual-ness of a traditional SSG.
1. Blackhole overcomes the perceived performance limitations of a scaled up live Grav implementation. Tested on sites with more than 20,000 pages.
