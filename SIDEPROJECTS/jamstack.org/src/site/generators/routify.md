Routify offers a great developer experience to build the routes for your Svelte app.

# Hit the ground running
No need to configure a single route. Routes are generated from file structure.

# Scoped everything
Layouts, helpers, props, fallbacks, you name it. It's all scoped and context-aware.

# Page transitions
Route-level page transitions for that native app feel.

# Single source of truth
If `/recipes/cupcakes` doesn't exist in your browser, it doesn't exist in your project. That's easy debugging.

# Resets
Sometimes you don't want everything to be scoped. Maybe you don't want `/restaurants/burger-queen` to inherit any layout.

# And more...
SSR, meta tags, code-splitting, real-time route generation... and more!.
