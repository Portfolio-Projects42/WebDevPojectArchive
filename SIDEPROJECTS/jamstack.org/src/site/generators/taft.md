description: Static site generator for the command line
---

Taft's goal is to allow building static sites from the command line, without extra config files. It's ideal for a workflow based around a Makefile. It does away with config files or init commands - the command used to build the site tells the story. Taft is lightning fast at the cost of doing away with some bells and whistles.
