---

**Spignite** works in Javascript; and uses existing, mature, libraries. In a nutshell, **Spignite** is a generic _file processor_, applied to a special case of building web sites. Simple file processing is the core concept **Spignite** is built upon.

All this makes **Spignite** easy to use and extend (it's all just Javascript after all) and - quite fast.

Works with HTML, Markdown, Nunjucks, Pug, SASS... And yes, you will probably need to use some JavaScript code :)

Nothing more, nothing less.
