description: Dead simple static blog generator written in Scala.
---

Scalatic is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Scalatic takes your content, renders GitHub flavored Markdown templates using the GitHub API, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. A typical usage of Scalatic is to host blogs using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

### Philosophy

Scalatic has been created with simplicity in mind: all you need to do is get the [executable .JAR](https://github.com/padurean/scalatic/releases) and run it using `java -jar scalatic-X.X.X.jar /path/to/your/blog`. The only parameter required is the path to your blog source files. Scalatic gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.
