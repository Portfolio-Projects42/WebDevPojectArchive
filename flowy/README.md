## Installation

Adding Flowy to your WebApp is incredibly simple:

1. Include jQuery to your project
2. Link `flowy.min.js` and `flowy.min.css` to your project

## Running Flowy

### Initialization

```javascript
flowy(canvas, ongrab, onrelease, onsnap, spacing_x, spacing_y);
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `canvas` | _jQuery object_ | The element that will contain the blocks |
| `ongrab` | _function_ (optional) | Function that gets triggered when a block is dragged |
| `onrelease` | _function_ (optional) | Function that gets triggered when a block is released |
| `onsnap` | _function_ (optional) | Function that gets triggered when a block snaps with another one |
| `spacing_x` | _integer_ (optional) | Horizontal spacing between blocks (default 20px) |
| `spacing_y` | _integer_ (optional) | Vertical spacing between blocks (default 80px) |

To define the blocks that can be dragged, you need to add the class `.create-flowy`

### Example

**HTML**

```html
<div class="create-flowy">The block to be dragged</div>
<div id="canvas"></div>
```

**Javascript**

```javascript
var spacing_x = 40;
var spacing_y = 100;
// Initialize Flowy
flowy($('#canvas'), onGrab, onRelease, onSnap, spacing_x, spacing_y);
function onGrab(block) {
  // When the user grabs a block
}
function onRelease() {
  // When the user releases a block
}
function onSnap(block, first, parent) {
  // When a block snaps with another one
}
```

## Callbacks

In order to use callbacks, you need to add the functions when initializing Flowy, as explained before.

### On grab

```javascript
function onGrab(block) {
  // When the user grabs a block
}
```

Gets triggered when a user grabs a block with the class `create-flowy`

| Parameter | Type            | Description                     |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `block`   | _jQuery object_ | The block that has been grabbed |

### On release

```javascript
function onRelease() {
  // When the user lets go of a block
}
```

Gets triggered when a user lets go of a block, regardless of whether it attaches or even gets released in the canvas.

### On snap

```javascript
function onSnap(block, first, parent) {
  // When a block can attach to a parent
  return true;
}
```

Gets triggered when a block can attach to another parent block. You can either prevent the attachment, or allow it by using `return true;`

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `block` | _jQuery object_ | The block that has been grabbed |
| `first` | _boolean_ | If true, the block that has been dragged is the first one in the canvas |
| `parent` | _jQuery object_ | The parent the block can attach to |

## Methods

### Get the flowchart data

```javascript
// As an object
flowy.output();
// As a JSON string
JSON.stringify(flowy.output());
```

The JSON object that gets outputted looks like this:

```javascript
[
	html: "",
	blockarr: [],
	blocks: [
		{
			"id": 1,
			"parent": 0,
			"data": [
				{
				"name": "blockid",
				"value": "1"
				}
			],
			"attr": [
				{
				"id": "block-id",
				"class": "block-class"
			]
		}
	]
]
```

Here's what each property means:

| Key | Value type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `html` | _string_ | Contains the canvas data |
| `blockarr` | _array_ | Contains the block array generated by the library (for import purposes) |
| `blocks` | _array_ | Contains the readable block array |
| `id` | _integer_ | Unique value that identifies a block |
| `parent` | _integer_ | The `id` of the parent a block is attached to (-1 means the block has no parent) |
| `data` | _array of objects_ | An array of all the inputs within a certain block |
| `name` | _string_ | The name attribute of the input |
| `value` | _string_ | The value attribute of the input |
| `attr` | _array of objects_ | Contains all the data attributes of a certain block |

### Import the flowchart data

```javascript
flowy.import(output);
```

Allows you to import entire flowcharts initially exported using the previous method, `flowy.output()`

| Parameter | Type          | Description                    |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `output`  | _JSON object_ | The data from `flowy.output()` |

### Delete all blocks

To remove all blocks at once use:

```javascript
flowy.deleteBlocks();
```

Currently there is no method to individually remove blocks. The only way to go about it is by splitting branches manually.
