Elmstatic is a static site generator that allows you to write page layouts in Elm,
and content in Markdown. You're free to use whatever you like for layouts:
`elm/html`, `elm-css`, `elm-ui` etc.

It can generate sites with pages and blog posts, post tags and post lists for each tag,
subsections with their own post streams, and RSS feeds.
