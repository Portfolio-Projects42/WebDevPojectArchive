## Static web galleries for all your photos and videos

Give `thumbsup` a folder full of photos and videos, and it will build HTML galleries to view them.
It takes care of resizing photos, creating thumbnails, re-encoding videos to a web-friendly format, and more...

## Highlights

- Get started in seconds

Create a whole gallery from a single command.
If you have more time, pick a theme, configure your styles, or change the config settings to control how albums are created.

- Fast

Thumbsup keeps track of which photos are new and only rebuilds what's necessary.
If everything is up to date, running thumbsup on a 50GB folder only takes a few seconds.

- Mobile friendly

The generated website can be viewed on any device - including videos.
Have a look for yourself at the demo site.

- Cross-platform

Available as an npm module or a Docker image, it works on macOS, Linux and Windows.
Thumbsup it built upon well established tools like ffmpeg.

- Deploy anywhere

The generated galleries are fully static and self contained.
Browse them from your computer, or upload them to AWS S3 for the world to see.
