description: A radically simple, zero-config static site generator.
---

A bare-bones, zero-configuration **static site generator** that deliberately has **no features**, an experiment in radical simplicity. Essentially a tiny, elegant glue between [EJS templates](https://ejs.co/) and [Markdown](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/) with freeform structure (enabling incremental adoption) and convenient defaults, written in under 120 lines of JavaScript.
