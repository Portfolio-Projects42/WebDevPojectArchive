An easy way to export your Vue.js Web Application into a static website.

## Easy to use

Write your content in [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) files only.
No configuration is needed, just write your Application with Vue.js components.

## Customisable

If you want to write you content in markdown files, its super easy with the [vue markdown filter](https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/)

You can extend your Application, Blog or Website with some packages on the [NPM ecosystem](http://npmjs.org/).

Nuxt will help you generate and deploy a Vue.js Web Application faster than before.

## Static and dynamic

[Vue SSR](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ssr.html) is used to generate pages for both client and server;
It's called Isomorphic/ Universal rendering.

Then you can run `nuxt generate` to generate your static website into a ./dist folder and deploy it everywhere:

Netlify, GitHub Pages, GitLab, AWS3, etc.

## Setup a project in a minute

Creating a website based on Nuxt only takes a minute.
