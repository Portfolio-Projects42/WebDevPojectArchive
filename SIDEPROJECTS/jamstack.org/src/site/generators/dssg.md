Unlike other static site generators, DSSG doesn't differentiate between front matter and a content section in its content files. This makes it very easy to create web pages based on templates with multiple content sections.

For maximum flexibility, each project can be based on multiple templates.

Content may be written in both Markdown or pure HTML.
