Flatmarket is a free, open source e-commerce platform for static websites. It is reliable, secure, and inexpensive to operate.

The platform uses Stripe for payment processing and is built on the latest web technologies like hapi, React, and Webpack.

At its core is a batteries-included CLI to help you get started quickly. Modules are also packaged individually so you can customize your rig.
