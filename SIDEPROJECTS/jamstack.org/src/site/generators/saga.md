Saga is a static site generator, written in Swift, allowing you to supply your own metadata types for your items. Saga uses a system of extensible readers, writers and renderers supporting things like Atom feeds, paginating and strongly typed HTML templates. It comes with a development server which watches for changes in your content, rebuilds your website and refreshes your browser.
