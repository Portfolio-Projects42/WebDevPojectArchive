Everything that can be represented as a String can be written to a file.

## Features

- incremental rendering and file watching
- custom, extensible and **typesafe**:
  - templates
  - variables
  - abstractions (data, functions)
- Markdown syntax
- Prismjs code highlighter
- Katex or Mathjax for math formulas
- PDF rendering
- form helpers
- simple installation, it's just an sbt plugin
