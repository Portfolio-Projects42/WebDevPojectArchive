Static Site Boilerplate is a better workflow for building modern static websites. Automated build processes, a local development server, production minification and optimizations, and the latest standards for static websites.

## Philosophy

We keep our opinions to ourselves. Write your code however youâ€™d like, then generate a ready to deploy website with a single command.
