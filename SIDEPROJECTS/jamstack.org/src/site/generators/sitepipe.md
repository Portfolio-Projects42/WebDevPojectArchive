description: Yet another static site generator - non-opinionated, value-level. Less magic == easier to understand
---

It's a simple to understand static site generator for making blogs, personal
websites, etc.

Instead of dealing with complex contexts SitePipe works with _values_. Values
are loaded from files and can be rendered into html. What happens to the values
in-between is up to you!

SitePipe provides a bunch of helpers for you, but at the end of the day you can
fit the pipes together however you like.
