Skua is a static site generator written in Python. Unlike many static site generators Skua doesn't offer a command-line interface – instead Skua projects are written using regular Python code which allows users to more easily customise their sites.

Skua supports markdown out of the box. Other types of files can be easily used by making use of Python's rich ecosystem.
