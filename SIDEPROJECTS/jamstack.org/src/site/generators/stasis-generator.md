Stasis is a simple and easy to use static site generator. It aims to provide production ready tools to create static website projects.

Stasis uses Handlebars templates to compile your Markdown source files into static HTML web pages. Scripts and styles are compiled using the powerful Parcel Bundler. It can handle sass, scss, ts and many more asset types and compiles them into pure javascript and CSS.

Each page can expose a GraphQL query to collect page data that you can use inside your _Handlebars_ templates.
