Nift, short for nifty site manager, is a cross-platform open source git-like and LaTeX-like site manager. You should be able to create any site you want (both static and non-static/dynamic) using Nift, though will need some kind of web server such as Apache, NGinx, a LAMP stack, etc. to host non-static/dynamic sites, whereas static sites can easily be hosted with platforms like BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab and Netlify.

### Philosophy

The intent for creating Nift (aka nsm) in the first place was to make a command-line site manager that was as git-like and LaTeX-like as possible, the creator/developer of Nift has achieved what was desired and hopes others may find it just as useful for their own wants and/or needs.
