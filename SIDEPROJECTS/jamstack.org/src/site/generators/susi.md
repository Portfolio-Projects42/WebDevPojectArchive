description: The SUper SImple site generator.
---

This is the Su​per Si​mple Si​te generator.  
You give it markdown files and (if you fancy) an HTML layout to render them into - and it gives you static HTML.

That's it. No magic, no fancy build tools - Markdown and HTML. Now go and make that website!

### Philosophy

Static site generation shouldn't be rocket science.

This is the **Su**&#8203;per **Si**&#8203;mple **Si**&#8203;te generator.

You give it markdown files and (if you fancy) an HTML layout to render them into - and it gives you static HTML.

That's it. No magic, no fancy build tools - Markdown and HTML. Now go and make that website!
