MarkBind is a website generator that can generate a website from markdown documents. While there are other markdown-to-html website generators around, MarkBind can generate more dynamic websites, as opposed to one-size-fits-all static content. MarkBind is particularly suitable to create content-heavy websites e.g., eLearning websites, online instruction manuals, project documentation etc. that aim for self-directed consumption.

## Features

- Support for Markdown and GitHub-Flavored Markdown
- Ability to add additional layers of information as tooltips, pop-overs, modals
- Ability to emphasize or de-emphasize content easily
- Ability to allow readers reveal content progressively
- Ability to reuse content easily

## Examples

Examples of websites built using MarkBind:

- [CS2103 Software Engineering - course website](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103)
- [CS3281 Thematic Systems Project - course website](https://nus-cs3281.github.io/website/)
- [TE3291 Software Engineering - course website](https://nus-te3201.github.io/website/)
- [se-edu/se-book - An online text book on Software Engineering](https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/)
