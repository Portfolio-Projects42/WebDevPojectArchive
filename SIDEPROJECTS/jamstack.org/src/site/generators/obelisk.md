description: Static Site Generator written in Elixir.
---

Obelisk is a static site generator written in [Elixir Programming Language](http://elixir-lang.org).

#### Goals

- **Fast**. Static websites can take a long time to generate when they start to grow large. obelisk should take advantage of Elixir's processes to increase this speed.
- **Simple, Obvious.** It should be very straight forward to add new content and modify the way that your site works.
- **Templatable.** It should be possible to store templates in github repos and reference them directly, allowing modification of the look and feel of a site instantaneously with no manual installation.
