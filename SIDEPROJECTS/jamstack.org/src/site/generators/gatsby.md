## Features

- Build sites with React.js components
- Hot reload editing. Tweak pages, templates, and styles and see changes in real time.

## Modern web tech without the headache

Enjoy the power of the latest web technologies – React.js, Webpack, modern JavaScript and CSS and more — all setup and waiting for you to start building.

## Bring your own data

Gatsby’s rich data plugin ecosystem lets you build sites with the data you want — from one or many sources: Pull data from headless CMSs, SaaS services, APIs, databases, your file system & more directly into your pages using GraphQL.

## Scale to the entire internet

Gatsby.js is Internet Scale. Forget complicated deploys with databases and servers and their expensive, time-consuming setup costs, maintenance, and scaling fears. Gatsby.js builds your site as “static” files which can be deployed easily on dozens of services.

## Future-proof your website

Don't build a website with last decade's tech. The future of the web is mobile, JavaScript and APIs—the Jamstack. Every website is a web app and every web app is a website. Gatsby.js is the universal JavaScript framework you’ve been waiting for.

## Static Progressive Web Apps

Gatsby.js is a static PWA (Progressive Web App) generator. You get code and data splitting out-of-the-box. Gatsby loads only the critical HTML, CSS, data, and JavaScript so your site loads as fast as possible. Once loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so clicking around the site feels incredibly fast.

## Speed past the competition

Gatsby.js builds the fastest possible website. Instead of waiting to generate pages when requested, pre-build pages and lift them into a global cloud of servers — ready to be delivered instantly to your users wherever they are.
