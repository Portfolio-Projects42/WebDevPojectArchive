# Create a Coding Sandbox

Have you wondered how code editors such as [Codepen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) work?

<Iframe
  title="JavaScript Sandbox"
  src="https://javascriptsandbox.netlify.app/"
/>

[JavaScript Sandbox](https://javascriptsandbox.netlify.app/) to see the working example. You can find the [source code](https://github.com/JoysOfCode/javascript-sandbox) on GitHub.

**Note:** There's been a breaking change since I wrote this post regarding `@babel/standalone` that only requires a slight change. I decided not to update the source code, since I expect this to be reverted once the package issue gets resolved. These are the changes.

```html:index.html
<!-- Add @babel/standalone in your <head>...</head> -->
<script
  src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"
  defer
></script>
```

```js:app.js
// remove this line
- import { transform } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@babel/standalone'

// replace this line
- const { code: babelCode } = transform(codeToTranspile, options)
// with window.Babel (I use window to make it clear where it's coming from)
+ const { code: babelCode } = window.Babel(codeToTranspile, options)

// do the same for setIframeContent
- <script src="https://cdn.skypack.dev/@babel/standalone" type="module"></script>
+ <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js" type="module"></script>
```

## What You'll Learn

- Using the HTML &lt;iframe&gt; tag to create a live coding environment
- Implementing the Monaco (VS Code) Editor
- How Babel works
- Native JavaScript modules (often abbreviated as ESM)
- Use of closures by writing a debounce function
- Writing helper functions to make DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation easier
- Displaying errors from the console in the UI (user interface)
- Regex replacement

Let's start by playing detective 🔎, and examining Codepen's source code through the lens of our developer tools. This part is optional, as I only want to share my thought process with you.

If you're in a new pen on Codepen, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> to bring up the developers tools and inspecting the right side column. We notice something interesting. It's an [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe)! You can imagine an iframe as a separate page inside another page. By definition "it's a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one."

<Image
  height="745px"
  width="1276px"
  src="/images/create-a-coding-sandbox/codepen.png"
  alt="Codepen"
/>

An iframe behaves just like a regular page, but contained into it's own microcosm. This sounds like the perfect spot for a playground. We can already make a couple of observations.

## Observations

- The iframe behaves just like a regular page
- User inputs something on the left side (regular page)
- Output displays on the right (iframe)
- We can execute JavaScript

Now, any input would do. It can be just a plain textarea. It just happens that these sites are using "fancy" textareas that do syntax highlighting and other things for you. Codepen, and JSFiddle for example use [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/). CodeSandbox on the other hand is a lot more involved, and it's basically an IDE (integrated development environment) inside your browser. It uses the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/index.html) just like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) does. That's what I decided to use for this project.

We won't need any bundlers, or build tools. **The only thing required is the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code so you can start a development server because otherwise it won't work due to the limitations of using the file protocol.** If you prefer using something else, go ahead.

## Getting Started

That being said, start by creating a folder `js-sandbox`. Inside create another folder `src`, and a `index.html` file. Inside `src` create `src/app.js`, and `src/style.css`.

Keep in mind that for _Live Server_ to work it requires you to have a folder open inside VS Code. You can then start Live Server from `index.html` by pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to open your [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and find "Open with Live Server". You can also right click on the file, or press the bottom right "Go Live" button.

## Markup

Your `index.html` should look like this.

```html:index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>JavaScript Sandbox</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./src/style.css" />
    <script src="./src/app.js" type="module"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="code">
      <textarea id="editor" spellcheck="false"></textarea>
    </div>

    <div class="result">
      <div id="output">
        <iframe id="iframe"></iframe>
        <div id="errors" class="hidden"></div>
      </div>
      <div id="source"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Notice that instead of including our script in the `body`, we've done so in the `head` of our document. This is possible due to the `defer` property which waits for the page to load before running JavaScript. Before we could also use the [DOMContentLoaded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event) event listener to make sure our JavaScript doesn't run before the DOM is loaded.

In this case, we don't have to include it because _modules_ use it by default. In the past we had to use a bundler such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), or [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to be able to understand and resolve dependencies from NPM packages, and to use the `import` syntax. That's no longer the case with browsers now natively supporting modules. In the future, instead of using bundlers in development, they're going to be an optimization step when shipping code to the browser.

The downside is that we need to repack older packages not using ES modules so they work. This is where [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/) comes in to bridge the gap. If you've heard about the [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) competitor [Deno](https://deno.land/), it's the same concept how it deals with packages. Instead of having to do `npm install package` and dealing with `node_modules` you simply use a url to import the package which is smart enough to resolve the dependenices, and do the caching over a CDN (content delivery network).

```html:example.html
<button id="btn">Click</button>

<script type="module">
  import confetti from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/canvas-confetti'
  btn.onclick = confetti
</script>
```

One thing to note is that `defer` only works when you include `src`, or if it's a module. If any of this is unfamiliar to you, take some time to research each subject, because modules are an important aspect of JavaScript.

## Styles

For the most part, it's a simple layout. Just paste and forget these styles in `style.css` so we can focus on JavaScript.

```css:style.css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;700&display=swap');
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=IBM+Plex+Mono&display=swap');

:root {
  --font-size: 1.25rem;
  --spacing: 2rem;
  --sans-serif: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  --mono: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace;
}

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  /*
    uses any border and padding as part of the
    element's width and height
  */
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  display: flex;
  color: seashell;
  font-family: var(--sans-serif);
  font-size: var(--font-size);
  overflow: hidden;
}

h3 {
  position: absolute;
  right: 20px;
  font-size: 1rem;
  background-color: wheat;
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
  padding: 0.4rem 0.8rem;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

.code,
.result {
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100%;
}

#editor {
  height: 100%;
  min-width: 50vw;
  max-width: 100vw;
  font-size: inherit;
  /* makes the element resize like a textarea */
  resize: horizontal;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.result {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

#output,
#source {
  position: relative;
  height: 50%;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
  overflow-x: hidden;
}

#iframe {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  border: none;
}

#errors {
  padding: var(--spacing);
  color: tomato;
}

#errors pre {
  max-width: 80%;
}

#source {
  padding: 1rem var(--spacing);
  border-top: 2px solid hsl(0, 0%, 10%);
  line-height: 1.6;
}

pre {
  font-family: var(--mono);
  /* changes how text is displayed in a pre */
  white-space: pre-wrap;
  word-wrap: break-word;
}

.hidden {
  display: none;
}

@media (max-width: 800px) {
  body {
    display: block;
    overflow: scroll;
  }

  .code,
  .result {
    height: 50vh;
  }

  #editor {
    resize: none;
  }

  #output {
    height: 100%;
  }

  #source {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

That's it 😄 Notice we can resize the editor window using the bottom right triangle shape.

<Iframe
  title="JavaScript Sandbox"
  src="https://javascript-sandbox-examples.netlify.app/01-starter/"
/>

## The Sandbox

Inside `src` create a `utility.js`. Here we're going to put our helper functions.

```js:utility.js
export function getEl(id) {
  // returns element by id
  return document.getElementById(id)
}

export function createEl(tag, content) {
  if (content) {
    // creates a nice API like createEl('h1, 'Hello, World!')
    const domEl = document.createElement(tag)
    domEl.innerText = content

    return domEl
  }

  return document.createElement(tag)
}
```

We're set! Head back to `app.js` and let's get started. First let's import the utilities, and grab the DOM elements.

```js:app.js
import { createEl, getEl } from './utility.js'

const iframeEl = getEl('iframe')
const errorsEl = getEl('errors')

const editorEl = getEl('editor')
const sourceEl = getEl('source')
```

The \*_.js_ extension is required. If you work with a bundler like Webpack you don't have to since it handles that for you.

Let's add a way to get the input, and output it. We're using a textarea to focus on the main concept, instead of implementation.

How do we modify the contents of an iframe? The easiest method is using the [srcdoc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLIFrameElement/srcdoc) method which specifies the content of an iframe. To achieve the live update effect, we're just going to attach a `keyup` event listener to our textarea.

```js:app.js
function getCode() {
  // get contents of the textarea
  return editorEl.value
}

function setIframeContent(code) {
  const source = `
    <html>
    <head>
      <style>
        @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;700&display=swap');

        body {
          font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
          overflow: hidden;
        }

        .app {
          padding: 0 2rem;
          color: snow;
        }

        .app a {
          color: wheat;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="app"></div>

      <script src="https://cdn.skypack.dev/@babel/standalone" type="module"></script>
      <script type="text/babel" data-type="module">
        ${code}
      </script>
    </body>
    </html>
  `

  iframeEl.srcdoc = source
}


function updateUI() {
  // get what we typed
  const code = getCode()
  // pass it to update the iframe
  setIframeContent(code)
}

// handler
function handleKeyUp() {
  updateUI()
}

// keyup listener
editorEl.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp)
```

This is basically building our "template" to pass to the iframe. You can realize how easily you can make Codepen out of this. In this case we're going to focus on JavaScript. In reality you can pass anything such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to it. In fact, I encourage you to stop what you're doing, and do it just to learn.

<Iframe
  title="JavaScript Sandbox"
  src="https://javascript-sandbox-examples.netlify.app/02-code-output/"
/>

I included an empty div to have a mount point for frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). My primary goal is to not recreate Codepen, but to dive deeper into how it works. You can repurpose this to anything you want.

If you're cool, we can proceed. I mentioned something about transpiled code, but that might not mean anything to you. This is where [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) comes in. Babel is a JavaScript compiler that can take modern JavaScript syntax that might not be supported across browsers, and transpile (you might hear compile, it's interchangable) it to an older version of JavaScript. This enables us to write modern JavaScript today, and let Babel do the hard work. Modern development wouldn't be the same, or possible without it.

Where Babel is also useful, is transpiling [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) (JavaScript XML, used in place of HTML popularized by frameworks like React) to what browsers can understand, and it has other presets, and plugins. The last part isn't important if you don't know React.

The _text/babel_ type let's Babel know to process the code, and we have to include a special [data attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) to use modules with Babel.

```js:example.js
// ES6+ code
const banana = 'banana'

// Babel ES5 output
var banana = 'banana'
```

This is a boring example, but it gets a lot cooler when using [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) like _classes_, and seeing how it works under the hood! We're going to explore this in a moment, since we're going to implement it. This is what gets me more excited than just making another Codepen.

## Babel

You might have noticed the [@babel/standalone](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-standalone.html) import. This let's us use Babel client-side (in the browser). It's perfect for this project. We have to import the package inside the parent `app.js` because iframes are sandboxed (pun intended) so we can't use the one already declared.

```js:app.js
import { transform } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@babel/standalone'
```

The regular import is just `Babel`. We can destructure `transform` from it so we only use what we need.

We're going to add a `transpileCode` function inside `updateUI` and also pass it `code` so we can work with it. You can place it anywhere.

```js:app.js
function transpileCode(code) {
  // the magic sauce used to transpile the code
  const options = { presets: ['es2015-loose', 'react'] }
  // transform returns an object so we can destructure and rename it
  const { code: babelCode } = transform(code, options)

  // it's going to append each time
  // so we need to clear it
  sourceEl.innerHTML = ''

  // using our DOM helpers we created earlier
  const titleEl = createEl('h3', '📜 Source')
  const preEl = createEl('pre', babelCode)

  /*
    <div id="source">
      <h3>📜 Source</h3>
      <pre>...</pre>
    </div>
  */
  sourceEl.append(titleEl, preEl)
}

function updateUI() {
  const code = getCode()

  setIframeContent(code)
  transpileCode(code)
}
```

[Pre](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre) is just a useful tag to show preformatted text. We can also control how the text is formatted in CSS.

We can pass different presets to Babel, telling it what version of JavaScript to target. In this case I'm using the _es2015-loose_ preset and _react_ for [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). The _loose_ in the preset means it's going to output code that's more human readable, and doesn't strictly adhere to the JavaScript specification. If you just used [the destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) for example, it would quickly saturate the output.

I encourage you to play around. These yearly presets have been deprecated for [@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) which you should use in production. You would just have to replace _es2015-loose_ with _env_.

The last part is the `transform` itself which accepts the _input_, _options_, and returns an object.

```js:example.js
const input = `const getMessage = () => 'Hello, World!'`
const output = Babel.transform(input, { presets: ['env'] }).code
```

There's also a [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl) you can use to play around. That's how I found out about the presets, because the docs aren't that clear to the uninitiated. I won't go into the minutia of how Babel works under the hood, unless you want to read about [ASTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (abstract syntax tree), and because I only understand the concepts.

## Regex Replacement

We can import NPM packages straight into our code, instead of appending them as a script like Codepen would. That means they're also going to get transpiled. We can fix that by using _regex_ to remove them before they get transpiled. You might have noticed the _/\*#\_\_PURE\_\_\*/_ string created by Babel. Since we only care about the output, we're also going to remove it.

You don't need to understand regex, but if you want you can use [RegExr] to examine an expression. I know enough myself to be able to read it, since I rarely use it. When I need it, I just search for what I'm looking for, and it works out. First let's add some regex patterns at the top of `app.js`, right below where we grab the DOM elements.

```js:app.js
const importsMatchRegex = /import(?:["'\s]*([\w*{}\n\r\t, ]+)from\s*)?["'\s].*([@\w/_-]+)["'\s].*/g
const stringMatchRegex = /\/\*#__PURE__\*\//g
```

The [imports regex](https://gist.github.com/manekinekko/7e58a17bc62a9be47172) just matches anything that starts with _import_ and could be a default or named import spanning multiple lines. For the string regex we just target the specified string and escape the special characters with slashes.

Regex itself isn't hard, it's just hard to read. If you need to use it, just reach for a battle-tested one because there might be edge cases you didn't think of.

We need to update `transpileCode`. We're also going to add a `format` function above it that's going to abstract the regex replacement code so it looks neat. I don't look in advance to break code up like this. In fact it's spaghetti, before I decide to clean it up.

```js:app.js
// makes for a nicer API to work with
function format(string, regex, replacement = '') {
  return string.replace(regex, replacement).trim()
}

function transpileCode(code) {
  // remove the imports before transform
  const codeToTranspile = format(code, importsMatchRegex)

  // the babel sauce
  const options = { presets: ['es2015-loose', 'react'] }
  const { code: babelCode } = transform(codeToTranspile, options)

  // ignore /*#__PURE__*/ from transpiled output
  const transpiledCode = format(babelCode, stringMatchRegex)

  sourceEl.innerHTML = ''

  const titleEl = createEl('h3', '📜 Source')
  const preEl = createEl('pre', transpiledCode)

  sourceEl.append(titleEl, preEl)
}
```

It was using prototypes 😱

## Debounce

So far so good, but if we open dev tools and look at the console, there's an avalanche of output. This is not a great user experience. Imagine talking and being interrupted for not finishing your thought. We want to add a delay to the input. This is what's known as a _debounce_. Imagine typing something into a search field that queries an API endpoint. You don't want to spam requests for each typed letter.

Open `utility.js`, and add the `debounce` function — then import it in `app.js`.

```js:utility.js
export function debounce(callback, delay) {
  let timerId

  return () => {
    clearTimeout(timerId)
    timerId = setTimeout(callback, delay)
  }
}
```

```js:app.js
import { createEl, debounce, getEl } from './utility.js'
```

The debounce is just a `setTimeout` that accepts a _callback_ function to run after it's done, and a _delay_ in milliseconds. It returns a function that clears the previous `setTimeout`, and sets a new one. This is possible due to [closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).

**A closure is when a function remembers it's outer state, even after execution**.

You could say that "it closes over it". You're using closures in JavaScript without even knowing.

```js:example.js
const greet = () => console.log('Hello, World!')

// if we don't return a function we need to wrap it
document.addEventListener('click', () => debounce(greet, 1000))

// we return a function, so it's good
document.addEventListener('click', debounce(greet, 1000))
```

Even if the functions runs, thanks to _closures_ it remembers the value of `timerId`, so it can clear it.

Try it out yourself! The dev tools are a quick and easy way to get your hands dirty.

Let's update our event listener.

```js:app.js
editorEl.addEventListener('keyup', debounce(handleKeyUp, 1000))
```

There should be a delay of one second 🙅‍♀️

<Iframe
  title="JavaScript Sandbox"
  src="https://javascript-sandbox-examples.netlify.app/04-debounce-output/"
/>

## Errors

How do we display errors? We clearly see them in the console. There's a couple of ways. In JavaScript we can rewrite anything, so we could do that for `console` by just redeclaring it.

```js:example.js
console.error = () => {
  // hijack log to output to a DOM element
}
```

This is ugly for many reasons, one of which is overwriting how console itself works.

Fortunately, there's an easier method. We can use the [GlobalEventHandlers.onerror](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onerror) listener.

It's just a regular listener that we can place on the _window object_, and listen for error messages. It's almost that easy! In our case we have to attach the listener inside our iframe, and somehow send them up to the parent. There's a handy [window.postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) method for doing such.

If you're wondering, I had weird issues just using it on the parent itself where it would ignore certain types of errors.

We're just going to add another script section at the end of `setIframeContent`. If our code fails at any point, it's not going to run. It needs to be separate. Everything else is the same as before.

```js:app.js
function setIframeContent(code) {
  const source = `
    <!-- ... -->
    <body>
      <!-- ... -->
      <script>
        function handleError({ message: errorMessage }) {
          window.parent.postMessage(errorMessage, '*')
        }

        window.addEventListener('error', handleError)
      </script>
    </body>
  `

  iframeEl.srcdoc = source
}
```

Note that the event listener passes an event object which we can destructure and rename `event.message` from. We specify the sender by saying `window.parent` and the arguments are the _message_, and _target origin URI_ if we want to require it, but the _\*_ symbol let's it be anything.

Great! Now we can listen for any message. Let's add a `message` listener, after our `keyup` listener. We're also going to need a `handleMessage`.

```js:app.js
function handleMessage({ data: errorMessage }) {
  if (typeof errorMessage === 'string') {
    logErrors(errorMessage)
  }
}

window.addEventListener('message', handleMessage)
```

The response we get is `event.data` so we destructure it. We check if `message` is a string, meaning it's our error message because it could be anything.

We're going to send the error message to `logErrors`.

```js:app.js
function logErrors(error) {
  // clear errors
  errorsEl.innerHTML = ''

  // create title and pre element
  const titleEl = createEl('h3', '💩 Oops!')
  const preEl = createEl('pre', error)

  /*
    <div id="errors" class="hidden">
      <h3>💩 Oops!</h3>
      <pre>...</pre>
    </div>
  */
  errorsEl.append(titleEl, preEl)
}
```

One more thing. We need a way to show or hide our iframe, and errors depending if there's any. That's simple enough. There's already a class of `hidden` in `style.css` that just sets `display: none`. We just need to add the JavaScript.

```js:app.js
function logErrors(error) {
  iframeEl.classList.add('hidden')
  errorsEl.classList.remove('hidden')
  // ...
}

function setIframeContent(code) {
  iframeEl.classList.remove('hidden')
  errorsEl.classList.add('hidden')
  // ...
}
```

## The Editor

The last thing left for us to do is replace our beautiful textarea with [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/index.html) which is easier than you might think. It's going to take more time explaining the details how I got it to work over a CDN, which I wouldn't recommend doing. I just wanted to avoid using a bundler, which would have been even easier.

First we need to edit `index.html`.

```diff:index.html
<div class="code">
- <textarea id="editor" spellcheck="false"></textarea>
+ <div id="editor"></div>
</div>
```

Second, in `src` create `monacoEditor.js`.

```js:monacoEditor.js
// import every named export
import * as monaco from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/monaco-editor'

The Monaco Editor is the base that VS Code uses. You don't get a sidebar or anything fancy. That's Microsoft sauce on top of it. They also develop all these projects together. It uses [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) which lets us off-load heavy tasks to background threads since JavaScript runs on a single thread, but the browser isn't limited to that. Fortunately, we don't have to think about that. I hope that clears up the `window.MonacoEnvironment` part.

This is only convoluted because we're using a CDN. There's a great [monaco-editor-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor-samples) repository with different examples how to set up Monaco Editor for different environments. You can also explore the [Monaco Editor API](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/index.html).

Import the editor at top of `app.js`. We also need to update `getCode` to grab the input from the editor instead. We also need `codicon.ttf` which is the [codicon](https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-codicons/dist/codicon.html) icon font it uses. You can get it [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons/blob/master/dist/codicon.ttf) and place it in the root of your project.

```js:app.js
import { editor } from './monacoEditor.js'

function getCode() {
  // built-in method to get the input value
  return editor.getValue()
}
```

Try it out!

```js
import confetti from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/canvas-confetti'
document.onpointermove = confetti
```

That's it! Congrats 🎉

## Closing Thoughts

Hope you learned something! There's a lot you could do from here on. You can add persistant storage using [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) so when you refresh the page it wouldn't reset. You would just need to save the input to local storage each time, and on page load check if it exists, then set the contents of the editor to use it.

You could also move everything to a bundler, or use a framework like React which I'm going to cover in another post.
