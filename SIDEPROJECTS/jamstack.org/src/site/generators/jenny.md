## Goal

Jenny aims to provide the simplest way to blog with the smallest
footprint possible.

There are draft and forward (scheduled) posting support.
Markdown through a modified Markdown.awk or MultiMarkdown.pl

Pagination is fixed, i.e. your first post will always be in
"Page 1".

Settings can be peristed in an rc file or overridden on run
time through command arguments.

The default theme is small and light, and the template nimble.
