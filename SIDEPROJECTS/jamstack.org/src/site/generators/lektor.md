Lektor is a static content management system that runs offline, written in Python.

- **Deploy Anywhere** Because Lektor builds out 100% static HTML you can deploy
  them to any host (including S3, github pages, any web host, etc.).
- **Cross Platform** It runs on Linux, OSX and Windows.
- **100% File Based** All source data is well structured and can be tracked in
  a version control system or cloud storage like Dropbox.
- **Flat-File Database** All source data is stored in a flat-file tree database
  and can be freely queried. The layout of that data is completely configurable.
- **Customizable Admin** Lektor comes fully equipped with a flexible and
  beautiful admin interface so you can edit your pages without having to touch
  the raw sources.
- **Dependency Tracking** The build process intelligently tracks page
  dependencies such that it only rebuilds pages that have changed.
- **Image Tools** Create thumbnails and give convenient access to EXIF data.
- **Plugin System** Lektor supports loading plugins that can customize a wide
  range of functionality.
- **Python API** The build system is written in Python and provides a
  documented API to extend it and integrate into other apps.
- **Multilingual** We can speak multiple languages and allow you to easily
  create localized websites.
