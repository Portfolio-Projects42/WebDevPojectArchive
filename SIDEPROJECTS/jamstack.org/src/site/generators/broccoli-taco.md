description: A fast, simple, and flexible static site generator based on Broccoli.
---

Broccoli Taco is designed to create data-driven sites with no database. Pages can pull in data (synchronously or asynchronously via promises) at build time. Arrays of data will generate a page for each item, allowing you to generate an arbitrary number of pages.

Thanks to [Broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli), re-generating the site is super fast. This makes for a really nice development process, especially when paired with livereload.

Check out the docs at http://broccoli-taco.com/ for more details.
