description: A web book-publishing system written in Racket with static html as default output target.
---

A book-publishing system written in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org). This is the software used to publish & maintain the web-based books [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com), [Typography for Lawyers](http://typographyforlawyers.com), and the forthcoming [Beautiful Racket](http://beautifulracket.com).

If you think documents should be programmable, youâ€™ll love it.  
If not, you can move along.

Pollen gives you access to a full programming language (Racket) with a text-based syntax that makes it easy to embed code within your documents.
