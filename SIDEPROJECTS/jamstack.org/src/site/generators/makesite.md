[makesite.py][repo] is a simple, lightweight, and magic-free static
website/blog generator written in Python for Python coders.

With [makesite.py][repo], you are in full control. There is no hidden
magic! There is no need to read any documentation to understand how it
works. There is no need to learn how to write configuration files to
produce some desired effect.

With [makesite.py][repo]:

- The [code][code] is the documentation.
- The [code][code] is the configuration.

Everything is laid out as plain and simple Python code for you to read
and enhance. It is less than 120 lines of code (excluding comments,
docstrings, and blank lines). It gets you off the ground pretty quickly.
You only need to execute `makesite.py`.

You can develop a decent website/blog within a few minutes and then you
can begin tinkering with the source code, the layout, and the stylesheet
to customize the look and feel of your website to your satisfaction.
