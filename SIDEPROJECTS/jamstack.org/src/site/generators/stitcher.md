Stitcher is a **PHP tool** for **developers** to create **high performant websites**. At its core, Stitcher is a
**static site generator** capable to work with popular **template engines**, and many data formats like
**MarkDown, YAML, JSON** and more.

Besides generating static sites, Stitcher has built-in support for **minification**, **image optimisation**,
and **CSS precompiling**.

It supports more advanced features than normal web pages, like **overview** and **detail** pages and **pagination**.
In the near future, Stitcher will also be able to handle **filtering** and **form submissions**.
