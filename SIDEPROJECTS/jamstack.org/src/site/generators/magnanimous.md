Magnanimous is a simple, fast static website generator made for programmers.

It has its own tiny template language to make it as easy as possible to include files or part of files into other files,
re-use variables, use for loops over literals or collections (e.g. files in a directory), compose components and many other things.

It is written in Go, so it is distributed as a single binary in all platforms, runs extremely fast and integrates very well with other
Unixy tools.
