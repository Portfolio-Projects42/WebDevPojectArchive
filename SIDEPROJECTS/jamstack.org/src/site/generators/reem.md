description: JavaScript static site generator for anything
---

Reem is different from other static site generators in the amount of control
developers are allowed during the build phase. The source directory is expanded
into a tree data structure that can be traversed and manipulated in ideally
any way desired and then is written to the output directory. Plugins are added to Reem like middleware in Express
and Reem seperates files into four middleware stacks, one each for posts, pages,
files, and lists (folders). Reem really is quite feature rich and should not be
summed up in a paragraph.
