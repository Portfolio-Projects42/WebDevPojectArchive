# What Is It?

A quick way to create a static travel blog, using your own text--and pictures that other people took.

# Why Use It?

You want to keep track of your travel memories but you:

- don't want to spend a lot of time taking that perfect photo
- don't want to spend a lot of time creating a website

# How To Use It?

Just run `make.py` and follow the instructions:

- 🏔 Enter the place names that you went to on your trip
- 🙌 Type 'done' when you're finished
- 🎉 Host your generated static site online

[Check out the docs on GitHub](https://github.com/martin-martin/lazy-travel-blog) for (slightly) more configuration options using a simple JSON file.
There are also some GIFs with examples. Have fun. 🙂
