Saber is a simple yet powerful framework for building modern static websites.

- **Static Rendering**. With Saber, static rendering with Vue.js is easier now than ever.
- **Zero Setup**. Automatic code splitting, file-system based routing, hot code reloading and built-in Markdown support.
- **Bring Your Own Data**. Build sites with the data you want: Pull data from headless CMS, SaaS services, APIs, your file-system, and more.
- **Fully Extensible**. With Saber's powerful APIs and plugin system, you can customize almost everything.

## Quick Overview

If you want to create a blog with Saber, you can achieve this by using a single command:

```bash
npm init blog my-blog
# Or if you prefer Yarn
yarn create blog my-blog
```

Then run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` in the created project and you're done!
