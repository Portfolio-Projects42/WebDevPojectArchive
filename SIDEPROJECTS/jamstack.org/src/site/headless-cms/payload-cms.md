[Payload](https://payloadcms.com/) is a self-hosted headless CMS and application framework built with Node.js, Express, React and MongoDB.

It’s meant to provide a massive boost to your development process, but more importantly, stay out of your way as your apps get more complex.

Out of the box, Payload gives you a lot of the things that you often need when developing a new website, web app, or native app:

<br />

- A Mongo database to store your data
- A way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data of any shape via full REST and GraphQL APIs
Authentication—complete with commonly required functionality like registration, email verification, login, & password - reset
- Deep access control to your data, based on document or field-level functions
- File storage and access control
- A beautiful admin UI that’s generated specifically to suit your data

<br />

### Why Payload?

The team behind Payload has been building websites and apps with existing content management systems and application frameworks for over a decade. We know what works and what doesn't about each of the existing solutions, and to this day have found no silver bullet solution.

<br />

#### **We believe that a CMS should be:**

<br />

- Cost-effective and should save time and effort
- Intuitive for developers and content authors alike
- Self-hosted however and wherever the application specifies
- Designed in code but used with no coding experience
- Blazing fast
- Secure
- Fully flexible and extensible

<br />

**Payload is our silver bullet solution.** It represents over two years of passionate development and brings everything we need when we build new apps and websites:

<br />

- A beautiful, dynamic, customizable admin UI
- Extensible and reusable authentication
- Content localization
- Local file storage
- Extremely flexible access control
- Field conditional logic
- Block-based layout building
- Array field type(s)
- Security
- and much more
