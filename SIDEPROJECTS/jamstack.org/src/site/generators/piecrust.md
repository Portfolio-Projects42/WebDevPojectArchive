PieCrust is a static website generator and flat-file CMS. No complex setup,
databases, or administrative panels its all text files. Simple, beautiful,
and yummy.

PieCrust makes creating and maintaining a website as easy as pie:

- Simple filling: itâ€™s all just text files!
- Store in the cellar: your whole website fits nicely in a revision control
  system.
- Bake and serve: generate a completely static website that will run with
  minimum resources for maximum scalability.
- Taste while you cook: preview your website instantly during authoring.

PieCrust uses all the ingredients you already like:

- Markdown and Textile for formatting.
- Jinja for writing layouts and re-usable bits of markup.
- Less, Sass and Compass for your CSS needs.
