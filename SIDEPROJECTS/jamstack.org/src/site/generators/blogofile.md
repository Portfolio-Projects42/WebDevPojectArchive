description: A static website compiler and blog engine, written and extended in Python
---

Blogofile is a static website compiler, primarily (though not
exclusively) designed to be a simple blogging engine. It requires no
database and no special hosting environment. You customize a set of
templates with Mako, create posts in a markup language of your choice
and Blogofile renders your entire website as static HTML and Atom/RSS
feeds which you can then upload to any old web server you like.
